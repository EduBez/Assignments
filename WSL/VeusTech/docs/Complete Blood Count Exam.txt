Complete Blood Count Exam (CBC)
Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)

There are four different components of RBC indices: 

Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)

Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW). 

The last one is a measurement derived from cell distribution curves generated on Automated Hematology Analyzers, and, combined with MCV, can help to diagnose many kinds of anemia.

There are two RDW measurements widely used: 

Standard Deviation (RDW-SD)
Coefficient of Variation (RDW-CV)

RDW-SD is an actual measurement of the width at 20% height level on the histogram.
RDW-CV is calculated dividing Standard Deviation of the Mean Cell Size by the MCV, and multiplying by 100 (to convert in percentage).

........................................................................
Your challenge is to decode RDW indices from a communication sequence that has been dumped by an Automated Hematology Analyzer.
........................................................................

Input:

The input must be read from standard input, indefinitely.
No extra or wrong data appear in the input, and only ASCII characters will be used.

A sequence starts by Red Cell Distribution Width Standard Deviation, with 4 characters, followed by a Carriage Return (ASCII code 13). 

The first two digits are the integer part.
The remaining two digits are the fractional part. 

Then comes the MCV, with 4 characters, followed by a Carriage Return,
The MCHC, with 4 characters, followed by a Carriage Return.
The MCH with 4 characters, followed by a Carriage Return.
The Coefficient of Variation, with 4 characters, where the first two digits are the integer part, and the remaining two are the fractional part, also followed by a CR. 

Output:

The output must be written to standard output.
No extra data should appear in the output, only (and precisely) the requested information.

For each sequence there must be printed:

RDW-CV value
RDW-SD value.

First the prefix “RDWCV=” (without quotes), followed by RDW-CV value with 2 integer digits, a dot, and 1 fractional digit. 
Then a comma must be printed, followed by “RDWSD=” (without quotes), RDW-SD value with 2 integer digits, a dot, and 1 fractional digit. 

Thus, the less significant fractional digits of RDW indices must be discarded (data will be truncated).
At the end of each the sequence, a Carriage Return must also be printed.
