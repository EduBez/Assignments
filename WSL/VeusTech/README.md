# VEUS TECHNOLOGY
## C/C++ Developer Test Task

This is the code for the VEUS Technology development assignment "C/C++ Developer Test" with:

  - Complete source code
  - Unit Tests writen in Google Test framework

## Features

  - Source code compatible with both Linux and Windows operating systems
  - Can be compiled with GCC or Visual Studio 2019

## Requirements

  - On linux you need GCC 8.3.0 or higher
  - On Windows you need Visual Studio 2019 Community version 16.1.6
  - CMake version 3.8 or higher
  - Google Test Framework (only needed if you intend to build and run the tests)

## Source Code

To build and run the source code, clone this repository, and install the tools described on the requirements section.  
After satisfying the requirements, open a terminal and type: 

```sh
$ cd <some_folder>/VeusChallenge/build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
$ ./RdwDecoder
```

## Unit Tests

To build and run the Unit Tests, open a terminal and type:

```sh
$ cd <some_folder>/VeusChallenge/gtest/build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
$ ./RdwDecoderTests
```

## Running The Program

RDWDecoder is a console application and should be executed inside a terminal.  
The program can be stopped by pressing ENTER.  
RDWDecoder will run indefinitely, reading data from the standard input, and displaying data on the standard output.  
The data dumped in the standard input is generated by an Automated Hematology Analyzer emulator that generates random RDW sequences.
